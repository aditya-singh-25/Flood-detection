FLOODHAWK: Flood Detection Using Sentinel Images

Project Description

This project leverages deep learning to detect and analyze flood-affected areas using satellite imagery from Sentinel-1 (SAR), Sentinel-2 (optical), and RGB image datasets. The system integrates three distinct models to handle different data types, providing comprehensive and accurate flood detection for disaster management and response.

Key Features:

1.	Multimodal Analysis:
	-	SAR Model: Processes radar images from Sentinel-1 to detect water presence under clouds or in low-light conditions.

	-	S2 Model: Analyzes optical images from Sentinel-2 to identify flood areas based on spectral data.

	-	RGB Model: Evaluates conventional RGB images for flood detection in visually accessible regions.

3.	Advanced Visualizations:
	-	Generates saliency maps, Grad-CAM, and Grad-CAM++ heatmaps for better interpretability of model predictions.

4.	Web Integration:
	-	A user-friendly website allows users to upload images, select the model type, and receive flood detection results with visual explanations
